    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored for efficient retrieval and manipulation. It is designed to store large amounts of information in a structured manner and provides mechanisms for managing, accessing, and manipulating that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, query languages, and underlying architectures. Here's a brief differentiation between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "1. Data Model: SQL databases follow a rigid, predefined schema that defines the structure and relationships of the data. They use tables with fixed columns and rows to store data, and relationships between tables are established through primary and foreign keys.\n",
    "2. Query Language: SQL databases use the SQL language to query and manipulate data. SQL is a standardized language that provides a set of commands for creating, modifying, and retrieving data from relational databases.\n",
    "3. Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increased workload by adding more resources (such as CPU, memory) to a single server. They are generally not as well-suited for horizontal scalability across multiple servers.\n",
    "4. ACID Compliance: SQL databases traditionally adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure data consistency and transactional integrity.\n",
    "5. Use Cases: SQL databases are commonly used in applications that require complex relationships between data, such as financial systems, content management systems, and applications that involve heavy data manipulations and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "1. Data Model: NoSQL databases have a flexible, schema-less data model. They can store unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data in various formats such as key-value pairs, documents, columnar, or graphs.\n",
    "2. Query Language: NoSQL databases often have their own query languages or APIs specific to the type of database. While some NoSQL databases support SQL-like querying, they generally offer simpler query models compared to SQL databases.\n",
    "3. Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability. They can distribute data across multiple servers, allowing for high scalability and performance in handling large-scale applications and big data workloads.\n",
    "4. ACID Compliance: NoSQL databases often relax the strict ACID compliance to achieve better scalability and performance. They may sacrifice some consistency guarantees in favor of availability and partition tolerance (known as the CAP theorem).\n",
    "5. Use Cases: NoSQL databases are commonly used in modern web applications, real-time analytics, content management systems, and applications that handle large volumes of data, as they offer flexible schemas, scalability, and high-performance capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of your application, including data structure, scalability needs, performance expectations, and development preferences."

    "Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each record in that table. It serves as a unique identifier and ensures the integrity and uniqueness of the data. The primary key constraint enforces that the values in the primary key column(s) must be unique and not null.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "1. Each table in a database should have a primary key.\n",
    "2. The primary key must have unique values for each record.\n",
    "3. The primary key column(s) cannot contain null values.\n",
    "4. A primary key can be a single column or a combination of multiple columns, known as a composite key.\n",
    "5. Primary keys are typically used as references in relationships with other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables based on the values of the foreign key and the primary key. The foreign key constraint ensures the referential integrity between related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "1. A foreign key is used to establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "2. It references the primary key column(s) of another table.\n",
    "3. The values of the foreign key must exist in the referenced primary key column(s) or be null.\n",
    "4. A foreign key can have a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-one relationship with the primary key it references.\n",
    "5. Foreign keys can be used to enforce data integrity and maintain consistency in the database by preventing orphaned records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary key and foreign key relationship allows you to link tables together based on their shared values, enabling you to retrieve related data from multiple tables using JOIN operations. This relationship is fundamental in establishing the integrity and structure of a relational database."

    "1. `cursor()` method:\n",
    "   - The `cursor()` method is used to create a cursor object, which allows us to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database.\n",
    "   - It establishes a connection between the Python program and the database.\n",
    "   - The cursor acts as a control structure that enables interaction with the database by executing queries and processing the returned data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `execute()` method:\n",
    "   - The `execute()` method is used to execute SQL statements or queries through the cursor object.\n",
    "   - It takes an SQL statement as a parameter and executes it on the connected database.\n",
    "   - The SQL statement can be a data manipulation language (DML) statement (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) or a data definition language (DDL) statement (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).\n",
    "   - The `execute()` method can also accept parameters that provide values for placeholders in prepared statements, preventing SQL injection attacks and enhancing security.\n",
